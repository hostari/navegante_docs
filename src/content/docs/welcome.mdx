Navegante is a next-generation Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) that aims to provide a simple yet flexible deployment experience for coders and non-coders alike.

Our platform is intentionally designed and optimized to provide a stress-free experience for anyone who wants to ship software to the web.
The current version of Navegante is our latest _stable_ version.
While we do not have feature-parity yet with other PaaS platforms, we hope that you'll stick around and support [what we are trying to do] with Navegante.
